                    <p class="aboutaccom"><b>“ The First Happening ”</b><br>
                        <br> “ When we are with the normal, natural, simple, easy, soft, tender, shallow, tranquil, peaceful flow of the breath … the mind becomes rather empty ”
                        <br> Meditation is silencing the incessant chatter of the restless mind. For that … we … begin … with … the … breath
                        <br> The mind has to be with the breath. That is the bottom-line. If the mind is not with the breath, it does, not become empty.
                        <br> The mind has to become uncluttered and rather empty.
                        <br> The mind has to lose all its unscientific socio-religious mental images and meaningless props. In the same token, chanting of any mantra doesn’t play any role in meditation. The mouth has to be kept shut.
                        <br> Since meditation is silencing the incessant chattering mind, we can’t have any mental image whatsoever to concentrate upon. No mental images whatsoever. No visualization exercises. And, again, no mantras in the mouth.
                        <br> We have to attune ourselves to our natural and normal breath. When we attune ourselves to the breath, the mind becomes by and by less tense … and less dense … and sooner than later, it becomes rather empty.
                        <br> Breath is not a part of the body; but it is in the body … and it is sufficiently material to focus upon.
                        <br> Breath is the ambassador of pure consciousness in the body. Breath is an incessantly happening thing. Breath does not age. Breath is so simple. Breath can be experienced. Breath can be grasped. Breath can be very easily attuned to.
                        <br> Being with the simple, natural flow of the breath is the ‘ alpha ‘ in the science of meditation.
                        <br>
                        <br> <b>“ The Second Happening ”</b>
                        <br> “ When the mind is rather empty, huge amount of cosmic energy floods into the physical body .. into the physical-ness ”
                        <br> A ‘ jungle-like mind ‘ doesn’t allow cosmic energy to enter into the body-system.
                        <br> When the mind is like a forest, it becomes a great barrier … it does not allow any cosmic energy to seep into the physical body.
                        <br> The ‘jungle-like mind ’ is so very impermeable. So very ‘ solid ‘ However, when the ‘ solid-like mind ’ becomes a ‘ liquid-like mind ’ or a ‘ vapour-like mind ’, there is so much more porosity and the mind becomes that much more permeable .. and … the cosmic energy floods into the physical body … following the simple laws of natural physics.
                        <br> The mind is the separator of the physical energy and the cosmic energy. When the mind is like a forest, it acts like a solid barrier.
                        <br> So, to make our ‘ solid – like mind ’ into a ‘ vapour – like mind ’ … where there are very few thoughts, and more number of gaps … that is meditation. And, the way is only through breath.
                        <br>
                        <br> <b>“ The Third Happening ”</b>
                        <br> “ When sufficient amount of cosmic energy enters the physical body .. the result is a reasonable amount of activation of the third-eye ”
                        <br> The culminating result in meditation is the activation of our ‘inner senses ’ or the ‘ third-eye ’. The end result of meditation is activation of our extra sensory perception. The final result of meditation is activation of our SOUL CONSCIOUSNESS. The final product of meditation is acquiring a SOLID SOUL.
                        <br> In the case of a normal man, it is as if the soul is lost. The soul is the paradise. In the case of a normal person, the paradise has been lost. The paradise has to be regained … that is done in meditation.
                        <br> The physical body needs to become saturated with cosmic energy. When the body is saturated with cosmic energy, when the black patches in the etheric body are dissolved, the soul’s potential becomes gradually kinetic. And, the soul has infinite potential, and Infinite capacity. However, all that is just dry and barren as long as we don’t awaken it through our mediation.
                        <br> The science of meditation is the science of energy maximization. The science of mediation is the true science of physical health. The science of meditation is the true science of joy. The science of meditation is the true unifying science. It unifies all the divided sects of humanity. Hail unto the science of meditation.
