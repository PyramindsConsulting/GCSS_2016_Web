            <p class="aboutcontent ">Life University is set amidst pristine, natural surroundings and both the land and surrounding atmosphere are charged with high energies. Work commenced on 10th June 2010 when a core group, under the leadership of Dr. Newton, visited the land and did a series of Meditations thereby creating the Astral Template of Life University. Life University is much more than just an educational institution. It seeks to create a spiritual community composed of people who understand spirituality, practice it, and live in oneness consciousness. It will become a city of light workers – a recreation of paradise on earth.

            <p class="aboutcontent ">Thriive is a theory. A simple one - a belief that all it takes to transform the ordinary to extraordinary is a pulse of energy. That all it takes to go from struggling “inside the box” to leaping “outside the box” is but a vibrating thought. A single instant, a moment of light, a revelation can at times break down those walls, and suddenly we begin to Thriive. STAY TUNED to connect to our growing network of Thriivers - people like us - homemakers, teachers, lawyers, corporators, artistes, musicians, actors, healers, therapists, and global coaches.
