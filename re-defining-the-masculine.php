                    <p class="aboutaccom">This experiential mini-workshop examines and challenges current definitions of masculinity, offers paths back to one’s deeper truth and introduces a new model of ‘relational living’ that will assist men in behaving responsively and leading courageously in the world.<br><br>
                    Participants will:<br>
                    ➣ consider ‘maleness’ from a historical perspective and its present day legacies<br>
                    ➣ codify ‘responsible masculinity’ from their own stories<br>
                    ➣ experience ways for men to re-connect with their bodies and hearts as a way into a deeper sense of who they really are<br>
                    ➣ explore the extraordinary potential of combining the female and male energies<br>
                    ➣ be introduced to Relational Living as a path to wholeness & fulfillment<br><br>
                        
                    The workshop includes gentle movement, guided visualization, individual & pair exercises oh, and fun. And it’s not just for men!</p>
