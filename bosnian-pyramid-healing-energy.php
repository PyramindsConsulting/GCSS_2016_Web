                        <b>TOPIC 1 : PYRAMIDS AROUND THE WORLD</b>
                        <br>
                        <br> The world of the past was the world of the pyramids. Author investigates hundreds of pyramids in China, Mauritius, Canary Islands, Bolivia, Peru, Indonesia, Mexico, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Belize and US making original conclusions on their origin.

                        <b>TOPIC 2 : LOST PYRAMIDS OF BOSNIA</b>
                        <br>
                        <br> Dr. Sam Osmanagich discovered first pyramids on European soil: Lost pyramids of Bosnia. After 360.000 hours in archaeological digging in a period 2005-2015, sample testing, radiocarbon dating and five scientific conferences, this discovery prove that our view of ancient past has to be changed. Bosnian pyramids are the biggest and oldest pyramidal structures on the Planet, with the best quality concrete and most precise side orientation to the cardinal points. Despite obstacles from cultural, media and political establishments, this project has grown to the most active archaeological site in the World.

                        <b>TOPIC 3 : ENERGY PHENOMENA OF BOSNIAN PYRAMIDS</b>
                        <br>
                        <br> Physicists, electrical and sound engineers detected and measured several artificial energy phenomena on the top of the Bosnian Pyramids: electromagnetic beam of 28 kHz, ultrasound, infrasound and beneficial Schuman resonance. Pioneering steps have been made in the Pyramid Science bringing us step closer in deciphering their purpose and connection with Teslaâ€™s free energy.

                        <b>TOPIC 4 : MYSTERIOUS LABYRINTH UNDER THE BOSNIAN PYRAMIDS</b><br>
                        <br> The most extensive underground network of tunnels and chambers has been discovered in the Bosnian Valley of the Pyramids 100 feet below the surface. Tunnels run for tens of miles. Absence of cosmic radiations and natural radioactivity and high concentration of negative ions make this underground world extremely beneficial to human health. Experiments prove that this complex was used as a place for rejuvenation and self-healing.
