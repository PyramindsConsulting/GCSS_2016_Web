                    <p class="aboutaccom">Astral travel is a much desired skill. It allows us to separate our subtle body from gross body. When we astral travel, we are able to explore various non-physical worlds and gain knowledge that cannot be gained from the material world in which we live our day-to-day lives.
                        <br>
                        <br> Now, with the aid of astral travel and soul science wisdom enable us to discover the answer to Man’s eternal question about life in the physical body. Death takes on a new meaning as we begin to realize that it is only a transition to another dimension. By learning to astral travel, we can learn many things about ourselves, and unlearn many things that were previously thought to be true. This leads us to the realization that our physical bodies are only a part of our entire selves, and there is more to our existence than meets the eye!
