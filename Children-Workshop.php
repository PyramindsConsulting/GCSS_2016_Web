                            <p class="aboutcontent">Mandalas may grow as pastel drawings, as large goup paintings, or as spontaneous installations in nature, using elements that can be found in the surrounding of the working space.</p>
                            <p class="aboutcontent">Mandalas have existed in human art maybe as long as human beings walk the earth...</p>
                            <p class="aboutcontent">A mandala is essentially a round shape, like the sun, or the full moon, like a balloon, an eye, a water drop falling, the core of a beautiful flower! We are surrounded by natural mandalas.</p>
                            <p class="aboutcontent">Shaping a mandala, letting its regular or irregular rows of ‘petals’ grow around a center on the paper or on the ground, gives a natural satisfaction, inner peace, a sense of completion. In our interaction with the outer world, we may create a mandala a day, to grow our own garden of Mandala Flowers of beauty, peace, harmony.</p>
