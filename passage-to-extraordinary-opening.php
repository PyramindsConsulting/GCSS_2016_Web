                    <p class="aboutaccom"><b>Date & Time :</b> Sep 30th, 2016, 6:00pm - 7:30pm</p>
                    <p class="aboutaccom">Judy Satori, a previous speaker at GCSS, is a spiritual activator and way shower. She transmits through her voice, hands and eyes energy transmissions from Source, God, designed to recode and activate more of our human DNA expression. Her mission on the planet is to activate human potential in a way that has only now become possible with the Earth’s shift to the fifth dimension. Judy works with multi-galactic and multi-dimensional beings of Light to demonstrate and guide a New Way for us on Earth…an evolutionary upgrade for humanity
                        <br>
                        <br> Judy will be presenting a two day post GCSS workshop in Pyramid Valley, incorporating a range of information and energy transmissions from Spirit. She will be teaching several topics to do with accelerating the ascension process, living a fifth dimensional life, activating previously dormant soul and DNA potential, being of service on the planet and moving beyond healing to physical re-genesis.
                        <br>
                        <br> Judy is the author of “Sunshine Before the Dawn”, a story telepathically downloaded to her by multi-dimensional Star Beings, which describes how and why human beings came to Earth from Star Nations within this galaxy. This story is a powerful memory catalyst and opens people to remember their own star born lineage. “Sunshine Before the Dawn” is available through the GCSS bookstore, or from Judy’s website, <a href="http://www.judysatori.com" class="link_style" target="_blank">www.JudySatori.com</a>
                        <br>
                        <br> Judy Satori is an energy conduit for Spirit, a step down transformer between Heaven and Earth, Source and Soul. Her mission is to activate human potential in a way that has previously been impossible while the Earth was vibrating in the third dimension. Now that the Earth has shifted to the faster pulsating energy of the fifth dimension, human beings can begin to be energetically recreated, to return to and go beyond the ‘perfected pattern’ that is our birthright. This evolutionary upgrade for humanity is part of a divinely orchestrated plan for Earth, our Milky Way galaxy, and for all the 22 galaxies, which together are configured in a diamond shaped grouping within this section of the Universe.
                        <br>
                        <br> Streams of light, energy and most importantly sound flow through Judy that generate peace and love in those exposed to her work. These transmissions also activate specific changes to the human genome – the DNA instructions for human life creation, activate previously dormant soul and human mind power potential and enhance physical vitality. Judy transmits energy words of new creation. These spiritual, multi-galactic languages are from God and are of love.
                        <br>
                        <br> For Judy, life changed in 1997, when in meditation she was connected with a being of Light who told her that his name was Balthazar, one of the three Wise Men, the Magi of Christian biblical tradition. For the next three years she studied energy healing, working in the human energy field, studying towards a NZ Diploma of Natural Healing Sciences. She was already a qualified physiotherapist. After a year working with Balthazar she was ‘stepped up’ by Spirit and began working with Ascended Masters such as St. Germain, Djwahl Khul and Kuan Yin; Lord Melchizadek, Archangels Michael and Metatron and others of the spiritual hierarchy.
                        <br>
                        <br> During her travels in India and Nepal she connected with and has since transmitted the energy of the Buddhist Goddess Tara, Lord Buddha, Lord Krishna and the Hindu Goddess Kali. She has a strong alignment with the work of Paramahansa Yogananda and his lineage of gurus, in particular Mahavatar Babaji.
                        <br>
                        <br> In 2002 her spiritual guides, by now primarily the Elohim, the Creator aspect of the Godhead, told her that they wanted to advance the work and sent her to Bali where she spent six weeks staying in a little cottage in the rice fields near Ubud, having daily lessons with Spirit about the limitations of third dimensional human DNA expression. The Elohim told Judy that when the Earth shifted into the faster pulsating energy of the fifth dimension in 2012, the physical body of man would need to be prepared and upgraded for this new faster pulsating energy domain. They said the physical body of man would be required to go through a process of re-synthesis and re-genesis. It was also explained that the upgrade of the physical body was also aligned with an upgrade in consciousness, in alignment with the fifth dimensional vibrations of peace, love and unity with all life.
                        <br>
                        <br> In 2002, Judy also began to automatically speak the very fast spiritual “Languages of Light” that are a major feature of her work. These languages are at times extraterrestrial languages from the “Star Nations” within this galaxy and at times energy words of re-creation, designed by Spirit to clear the sabotaging energy blocks and beliefs of past life trauma. Since 2015, Judy has been speaking energy words of re-creation and re-genesis, working to activate human DNA upgrade and RNA translation and expression.
                        <br>
                        <br> Judy Satori is now in her mid 60’s. She is the mother of two sons and grandmother of three. She travels internationally, teaching and writing. She is a frequent talk show guest on USA based radio global summits such as “You, Wealth, Revolution” with host Darius Barazandeh, and “Beyond the Ordinary” with host John Burgos. In 2015 she also hosted her own USA based radio show, “Beyond Healing” on the Pyramid One global network.
